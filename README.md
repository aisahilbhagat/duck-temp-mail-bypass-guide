# Use Duck Address with a Temp Mail — Quick Guide

A simple method to access websites that require email login or verification when you’re on public computers (school labs, library PCs, etc.) without using your personal email. This pairs a temporary email inbox with DuckDuckGo Email Protection so you can receive OTPs and verification links safely and easily.

## Why this helps
- **No personal email on public devices:** Avoid signing into your main account on shared computers.  
- **Bypass temp-mail blocks:** Some sites block direct temp-mail signups; a Duck address forwarding to the temp inbox can help.  
- **Works for OTPs and verification links:** Receive one-time codes and links in the temp-mail inbox.

## What you need
- A temporary email provider with an inbox (example: `temp-mail.org`)  
- DuckDuckGo Email Protection (`https://duckduckgo.com/email`)

## Quick Steps
1. Open a temp mail site and copy a temporary email address (make sure it has an inbox).  
2. Go to DuckDuckGo Email Protection: `https://duckduckgo.com/email`.  
3. Click **Get started** → **Next** → **Next**.  
4. Choose a Duck address (like `username@duck.com`). It’s throwaway — pick anything.  
5. When asked “Where should we forward your email?”, paste the temp-mail address you copied.  
6. Confirm and proceed to verification.  
7. Check the temp-mail inbox for the Duck verification code and enter it.  
8. After verification you’ll see `username@duck is yours!` — click **Next**.  
9. Use `username@duck.com` anywhere you need to receive OTPs or verification links; view them in the temp-mail inbox.

## Tips & Notes
- Temp mail services are sometimes blocked by websites; the Duck forwarding can help bypass those blocks.  
- Intended for temporary, one-off use on public/shared devices — do **not** use for accounts you care about long-term.  
- If something fails, try another temp-mail provider or search for troubleshooting steps online.

Enjoy safer, easier access on public computers — no personal email login required.
